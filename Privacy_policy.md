Minimalist AI-Translator Privacy Policy

Effective Date: April 25, 2025

Thank you for using the Minimalist AI-Translator Chrome Extension. This policy describes how we handle information when you use this extension.

1. About This Extension

Minimalist AI-Translator is a web page translation tool that allows users to translate web content using their own API keys for AI services such as OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Claude, or other compatible services. This extension itself does not provide translation services but acts as an interface allowing you to use your own AI service account and key.

2. Information We Collect

As the core functionality of this extension relies on third-party AI service API keys provided by you, we explicitly state:

We do not collect, store, or process your personally identifiable information (PII).
We do not collect, store, or process the specific web page content you translate or the translation results on our servers. All translation requests and responses are transmitted directly between your browser and the third-party AI service you configure, and may be processed by that third-party service.
Your API Keys: The API keys you provide are stored locally in your browser's storage (enabled by the storage permission) to allow the extension to make calls to your specified AI service API when you use the extension. These keys are not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties (other than the AI service provider you yourself configure). When you uninstall the extension, these keys are removed from your local storage.
Extension Settings: Your settings within this extension (e.g., preferred AI service provider, translation options, etc.) are stored locally in your browser's storage (enabled by the storage permission) to retain your preferences each time you use it. These settings are not transmitted to our servers.
Usage Data (If Applicable): We may use standard analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, if integrated) to collect anonymized usage data such as the number of installations/uninstallations, frequency of feature use, error reports, etc., in order to improve the extension's stability and user experience. This data is aggregated, anonymized, and cannot be used to personally identify you. (If your extension does not integrate any such analytics tools, please remove this paragraph)
Explanation of Permissions Used by This Extension:

storage: Allows the extension to store your API keys and settings locally in your browser.
host permission ([e.g., <all_urls> or specific site patterns]): Allows the extension to access the content of the web pages you are visiting in order to extract text for translation requests and display translation results on the page. We only access the content of the current page using this permission when you actively trigger the translation function, and this content is primarily used to generate the translation request sent to your designated AI service.
3. How We Use the Information We Collect

As stated above, the information we primarily collect is your provided API keys (stored locally) and optionally, anonymized usage data.

Your API keys and local settings are used solely to enable the functionality of the extension, i.e., to perform web page translation by calling the third-party AI service through your account.
Anonymized usage data (if applicable) is used only to help us understand usage patterns, diagnose issues, and make improvements to the extension.
4. Data Storage and Security

Your API keys and settings are stored in your browser's local storage and are not transmitted to our servers. The security of local storage depends on the security state of your browser and computer.
Translation requests and responses are transmitted directly between your browser and the third-party AI service you choose. The security and privacy of this data depend on your agreement with that third-party service and their security measures.
Anonymized usage data (if applicable) is stored on the secure servers of the third-party analytics service (such as Google Analytics) and is subject to their privacy policy.
5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your API keys, personal identifiable information, or the specific translation content processed through the extension with any third parties.

Your API keys are used solely for making requests to the third-party AI service you specify. Your interaction with these third-party services is governed by their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of the AI service providers you use:

[OpenAI Privacy Policy URL]
[Google Gemini/Cloud AI Privacy Policy URL, if applicable]
[OpenRouter Privacy Policy URL, if applicable]
[Anthropic (Claude) Privacy Policy URL, if applicable]
[Other supported service Privacy Policy URLs]
We may disclose information if required by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect our rights, comply with a legal process, court order, or legal request.   

6. User Rights and Choices

You can manage or delete your stored API keys at any time within the extension's settings.
Uninstalling this extension will immediately cease all data collection and API calls and remove your API keys and settings from your browser's local storage.
Regarding data processed through the third-party AI service, please refer to the privacy policy of the service you are using to understand your rights.
7. Children's Privacy

This extension is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we will take steps to remove such information.   

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective upon posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes. We may notify you of significant changes through extension update notes or other means.
